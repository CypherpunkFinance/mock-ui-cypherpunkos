# CypherpunkOS Mock UI

This project is a mock User Interface (UI) for CypherpunkOS. It's built using React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this mock UI is to:

*   Test out the look and feel of CypherpunkOS.
*   Gather feedback on functionality and user experience *before* implementing complex backend features.
*   Allow for rapid iteration on UI/UX concepts.

This approach helps in refining the user interface based on early feedback, ensuring that the final product is intuitive, without being slowed down by full-stack implementation during design.

## Live Demo

You can try out the live mock UI here:

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with Vite.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown in your terminal) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.

*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

*   `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.

*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally to preview it before deployment.
